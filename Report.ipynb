    "It is observed that the pickup and dropoff geolocations are the centers of Census Tract instead of the exact locations. This can be seen from the visual above (please check the interative kepler map `map_chicago_visual.html`). It makes direct interpolation for an arbitrary geolocation less interesting. Therefore, the Census Tracts features are introduced for better understanding of the pricing pattern \n",

    "\n",
    "### Fly Distance\n",
    "Since Miles are considered as the driving distance and the driving distance depends on a route engine to predict, we introduce the flying distance as a handy feature for predicting fare. The underlying assumption is the flying distance is highly correlated to the driving miles. \n",

    "### Pickup and Dropoff Census\n",
    "Chicago Census polygon data obtained from `https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Census-Tracts-2010/5jrd-6zik`. There are a total of 801 census tracks in Chigago.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Pickup and Dropoff geolocations, we can reverse geocoding the census name from the polygons. It is observed in `map_chicago_cencus_pickup.html` and `map_chicago_cencus_dropoff.html` that the unit price is higher in the downtown area - the East coast area of the city and generally lower at the outskirts.  \n",

    "In summary, we captures the following features that are most relavant to the fare of a hailing trip:\n",
    "\n",
    "flying_distance, pick_up_census, drop_off_census, hour of the day and day of the week\n",
